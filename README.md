# Initial_resume_parser

This is a simple attempt at breaking down a resume and providing a recommendation of a suitable job from
a list of available jobs - unfortunately due to confidentiality so of the code has to remain hidden and
has been commented out - the only resume that i can show is mine (though it was renamed to Peter Zminovic).

It uses name entity recognition and trains some spacy models. It is just sample code and doesn't work 
correctly.
